# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

We use [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](https://adr.github.io/) to track decisions regarding the architecture of the software and the project itself. We particularily use a very simple template due to the project and team size.

The following decisions have been tracked:
- [Choose a server/back end technologie](01-choose-server-side-language.md)
- [Choose a configuration method for the server](02-configure-server.md)
- [Select a dependency to read metadata](03-read-metadata.md)
- [Choose a fundamental client technology](04-choose-client-technologies.md)
- [Decide between server- and client based search](05-search-type-decision.md)
- [Select a dependency to write metadata](06-write-metadata.md)
- [Select a dependency to generate ZIP archives](07-select-create-zip-dependency.md)
- [Justify the use of Docker-Compose](08-docker-compose.md)
- [Justify why the multi language IPTC feature is not yet implemented](09-09-multi-language-iptc.md)
